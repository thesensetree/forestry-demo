                  <p>Our aromatherapy massage is adapted from the routine developed in the 1940's by French biochemist, a legendary pioneer in aromatherapy,  Marguerite Maury. It is a gentle and holistic approach to the therapeutic use of pure essential oils. The oils are diluted in nourishing carrier oils to detoxify the body and improve health via external application. Essential oils are absorbed through the skin during the massage. By focusing on pressure points along the spine, it stimulates the nervous system and promotes lymphatic drainage.The oil is applied in long sweeping strokes warming the skin and muscles and preparing the body for a deep relaxation massage. In addition, inhaling essential oil vapours has psychological effects by gently stimulating various parts of the brain.   Main benefits of Aroma-massage:  Increases blood circulation Improves lymphatic and nervous system Balances body, mind and spirit Encourages the elimination of toxins from the body Deep relaxation  What to expect The first treatment will start with a consultation.

Clients are advised to come in casual and comfortable clothing, without any makeup. Please let your therapist know about any areas that could provide discomfort during the massage.
