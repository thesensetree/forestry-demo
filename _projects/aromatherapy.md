Aromatherapy Massage

Our aromatherapy massage is adapted from the routine developed in the 1940's by French biochemist, a pioneer in aromatherapy,  Marguerite Maury.

It is a gentle and holistic approach to the therapeutic use of pure essential oils. The oils are diluted in nourishing carrier oils to detoxify the body and improve health via external application. Essential oils are absorbed through the skin during the massage. By focusing on pressure points along the spine, it stimulates the nervous system and promotes lymphatic drainage.The oil is applied in long sweeping strokes warming the skin and muscles and preparing the body for a deep relaxation massage. In addition, inhaling essential oil vapours has psychological effects by gently stimulating various parts of the brain.
