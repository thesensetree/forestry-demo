Reflexology has been practiced since ancient times in many cultures. There are reflex points in the hands, feet and ears that correspond to every part, gland and organ of the body. By stimulating these points, reflexology releases tensions, improves circulation and helps the natural healing process of the body. It is gentle and safe for any ages.

### Main benefits of reflexology:

* Relaxation
* Improves circulation
* Helps to normalize a body condition
* Improves sleep
* Promotes general health and well-being

### What to expect

During the treatment, the client will be lying on a table or sitting on a reclining chair. The client’s socks will be removed and the therapist will gently massage the clients feet and lower calf.

You will feel very relaxed and your feet light as if you’re walking on clouds.

The appointment is 60 mins,  includes a consultation and massage.

### After treatment

Clients are advised to drink plenty of water before and after massage in order to fully benefit from the massage. Intense exercises and other massages should be avoided for the rest of the day. It is also advised to have light meals and avoid alcohol following the treatment. This will allow your body to begin detoxification and flush out the toxins.
