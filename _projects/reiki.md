Reiki means ‘ Universal Life force Energy’. Reiki promotes physical and emotional healing and allows the body to heal. During your Reiki treatment, my hands will alternate between gentle contact and moving above your body. You will be fully clothed for the treatment and on a massage table or sitting on a chair. Reiki treats the person as a whole,  mind, soul and spirit to achieve an overall balance. Reiki not only removes stagnant energies, it also fills you with the positive and healing energy. It is safe and gentle for any ages. 

### Main benefits of Reiki:

* Increases energy
