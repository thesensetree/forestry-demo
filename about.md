I have always been interested in natural healing. In 2017, I completed my aromatherapy program at Joyessence where I discovered my inner calling to holistic healing. I am really fascinated at the effectiveness of holistic healing. I then became a registered reflexologist and reiki practitioner in 2018. Through my case studies, I saw amazing results through aromatherapy, reflexology and reiki healing. I am currently studying holistic nutrition at IHN. I hope that with my knowledge and experiences I can help people start their healing journey inside and out.
